Of course, some people push the envelope too far. Here are eight of the most notorious con artists, grifters, and swindlers from the 19th century onward.</p><img alt="american actress phoebe cates in the film princess caraboo 1994" title="American actress Phoebe Cates in the film 'Princess Caraboo', 1994." width=5188 height=3411 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-142533230.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>American actress Phoebe Cates in the film Princess Caraboo (1994).</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Princess Caraboo</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 1817, the residents of Almondsbury, England, were surprised to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/the-mysterious-princess-caraboo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="find a mysterious woman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">find a mysterious woman</a> in a shawl and colorful dress wandering around their village. She spoke an indecipherable language, though she seemingly referred to herself as “Caraboo,” and her recognition of exotic fruits like pineapples suggested that she came from Asia. Eventually, a Portuguese sailor agreed to “translate” for the stranger, relaying the information that she was a princess from the Indian Ocean island of Javasu who had escaped a kidnapping attempt by pirates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The woman lived comfortably for the next few months at the home of an Almondsbury magistrate, where she showed off her native style of dancing and religious worship to curious visitors until a landlady in nearby Bristol revealed that Princess Caraboo from Javasu was really Mary Willcocks from Devon. Apparently, the townspeople didn’t take the news too badly, as Willcocks avoided imprisonment and even got the magistrate’s wife to pay for her trip to America. She later returned to England, married, and settled down in a legitimate business of importing and selling leeches for medical purposes.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">George C. Parker</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The expression “If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you” is supposedly a nod to American con man George C. Parker, who made a living as a purveyor of New York City’s Brooklyn Bridge through the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As described in Carl Sifakis’s Hoaxes and Scams: A Compendium of Deceptions, Ruses and Swindles, Parker typically won over unsuspecting immigrants with offers to work in a yet-to-be-built toll booth before smoothly convincing them of the potential of buying the bridge outright. Occasionally, this resulted in police shutting down construction work from the confused victims who were trying to get their toll booths up and running.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Parker also sold phony deeds to other city landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Madison Square Garden, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, though he remained most proud of his continued success with the famous bridge. It was a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newspapers.com/image/59901394/?terms=George%252BParker" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="forged check" data-vars-ga-product-id=6ccf2981-f006-4db0-ae80-26af84f33e68 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/59901394/?terms=George%252BParker" data-product-url="https://www.newspapers.com/image/59901394/?terms=George%252BParker" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newspapers.com%2Fimage%2F59901394%2F%3Fterms%3DGeorge%252BParker" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$10.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e0808722-97d5-4974-9153-1647d197e88a class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">forged check</a> that finally brought an end to his grifting. His lengthy arrest record led to a lifetime prison sentence in 1928, though he reportedly enjoyed his incarceration thanks to the deference shown by admiring younger inmates.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Bigley/Cassie L. Chadwick</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Life on the straight and narrow was never in the cards for Elizabeth Bigley, who <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-high-priestess-of-fraudulent-finance-45/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="went by numerous aliases" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">went by numerous aliases</a> while defrauding banks and deep-pocketed investors through the Northeast and Midwest for more than two decades. Alternately posing as an heiress and a clairvoyant, Bigley first encountered trouble in the 1890s, when she was imprisoned in Ohio for three and a half years for forging checks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reappearing in Cleveland at the end of the decade, she married a wealthy widower and proceeded to burn through his money, purchasing expensive clothes, jewelry, and furniture. But a lavish domestic lifestyle wasn’t enough for the grifter, now known as Cassie L. Chadwick. She started a rumor that she was the illegitimate daughter of steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie, through which she was able to access loans and cash advances from an increasing number of lenders. One bank owner smelled something rotten by late 1904, however. Her failure to repay the $190,000 promissory note caused the web of lies to collapse. Following a high-profile trial in early 1905 that drew a curious Carnegie out to Cleveland to see the proceedings for himself, Chadwick died after less than a year in prison.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Charles Ponzi</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An Italian immigrant hustling to make ends meet in Boston, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/charles-ponzi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Ponzi" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Ponzi</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/charles-ponzi-the-financial-idiot-who-drove-boston-money-mad-in-1920/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="founded the Securities Exchange Co." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">founded the Securities Exchange Co.</a> in 1919 on the premise that international reply coupons purchased overseas could be redeemed for far greater value in the United States. Promising returns of 50 percent in 45 days, the dapper businessman lured approximately 20,000 investors into paying $10 million, a windfall that enabled him to pay for a mansion and limousine driver.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Of course, Ponzi was using the influx of new investors to pay promised returns to existing ones. His scheme came crashing down after his ostentatious displays of wealth drew closer scrutiny from journalists and federal investigators. Arrested in August 1920 on 86 counts of mail fraud, Ponzi spent most of the next 14 years behind bars and lived out his final days in poverty in Brazil. Still, he spoke of the excitement of having orchestrated such a successful scheme, an experience that other Ponzi scheme perpetrators like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/bernard-madoff data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bernie Madoff" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bernie Madoff</a> might relate to.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Frank Abagnale Jr.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Few tales of high-wire deception are more engaging than that of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/frank-abagnale data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frank Abagnale Jr" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frank Abagnale Jr</a>. Starting in the mid-1960s, according to Abagnale’s own account, the 16-year-old “Skywayman” hitched rides all over the globe while disguised as a Pan Am pilot, cashing in some $2.5 million in phony checks along the way. He also claims to have passed himself off as a doctor, an assistant district attorney, and a college professor until finally getting nabbed in France in 1970.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After four years behind bars, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://charlestonmag.com/features/bona_fide data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a reformed Abagnale" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a reformed Abagnale</a> began sharing his expertise at the FBI National Academy, churned out a 1980 memoir titled Catch Me If You Can, which became a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/leonardo-dicaprio data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Leonardo DiCaprio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>/<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/tom-hanks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tom Hanks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tom Hanks</a>-led film in 2002, and forged a lucrative career as a security consultant and public speaker.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Or so the story goes. According to Alan C. Logan’s 2020 book The Greatest Hoax on Earth: Catching Truth, While We Can, Abagnale actually <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://whyy.org/segments/the-greatest-hoax-on-earth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="operated on a far smaller scale" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">operated on a far smaller scale</a>, stealing from just a few families and businesses before getting busted. In other words, the con man’s greatest hoax may have been convincing everyone that he pulled off all the glamorous heists in the first place.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Lee Israel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For a while, Lee Israel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a23084048/can-you-ever-forgive-me-lee-israel-true-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="carved out a successful living as a biographer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">carved out a successful living as a biographer</a>, even cracking the New York Times best-seller list with her 1980 book on journalist Dorothy Kilgallen. But as it turned out, her talents lay in the impersonation of the literary figures she so admired. For about a year and a half in the early 1990s, Israel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/14/fakes-and-fortunes-has-the-time-come-to-forgive-literary-forger-lee-israel- data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="composed and sold some 400 letters" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">composed and sold some 400 letters</a> in the epistolary styles of Dorothy Parker, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ernest-hemingway data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ernest Hemingway" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ernest Hemingway</a>, Noël Coward, and others, using the specific vintage typewriter each writer favored. Then, after memorabilia dealers caught wind of her efforts, she turned to stealing the real letters from private collections and replacing them with her carefully constructed duplications.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The FBI finally closed shop on her operation in 1993, though she wound up with a relatively lenient sentence of six months of house arrest and five years of probation. Israel also leveraged her notoriety into one final book deal, a 2008 memoir titled Can You Ever Forgive Me?, which became an Academy Award-nominated movie starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/melissa-mccarthy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melissa McCarthy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Melissa McCarthy</a> the following decade.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Anna Delvey</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although many people adopt something of a cosmopolitan identity after moving to a new city, Russian-born Anna Delvey (born Anna Sorokin) took shape-shifting to an extreme degree.

Her eccentricities covered an inability to pay for expensive dinners and parties. The ruse proved good enough to arrange for long-term lodging in a swanky downtown hotel, and the would-be heiress even attempted to use made-up assets to acquire millions of dollars in loans to fund a glamorous new arts center.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimately, she was done in by her failure to pay her hotel bills and the frustration of a spurned friend, who got stuck with the $60,000-plus tab for a lavish vacation. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a38962970/where-is-anna-delvey-today/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Delvey was arrested" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Delvey was arrested</a> in Los Angeles in October 2017. Convicted on eight counts of grand larceny and theft of services in April 2019, she spent another two years in prison and wound up in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shortly after being paroled.

Hayut later resurfaced in Europe under his new name, allegedly to pass as a son of diamond mogul Lev Leviev, and proceeded to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a38955743/tinder-swindler-simon-leviev-true-story-where-is-he-now/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trick several women" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">trick several women</a> he met on Tinder into parting with credit card numbers and loans that were never repaid.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Apprehended in Greece in 2019, Leviev was extradited to stand trial in Israel for the 2011 charges—not the estimated $10 million he stole from various girlfriends—and spent just five months behind bars. His story also earned the Netflix treatment in the form of the 2022 documentary <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/title/81254340 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Tinder Swindler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Tinder Swindler</a>.
