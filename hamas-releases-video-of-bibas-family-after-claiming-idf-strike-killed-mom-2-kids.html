You killed my wife and children,” the dad says tearfully in the haunting footage.</p><p>“I’m begging you, bring my wife and my children back home. Please, I’m begging.”</p><p>Hamas claimed in a statement alongside the video that it had offered to return Shiri’s and her sons’ bodies to the IDF, but that the Israeli military refused.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Father-of-two Yarden Bibas was seen in a Hamas video reiterating the group’s claim that his wife and children were killed by an Israeli airstrike. <span class=credit>Hamas Military Wing</span></figure><p>Israeli officials, however, say they are still working to determine if the terrorists’ claims that Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were killed are even true.</p><p>“The Hamas terrorist organization presented harsh documentation of Yarden Bibas,” IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said of the footage.</p><p>“Our hearts are with the entire Bibas family. We will continue to return all our captives.</p><p>“Hamas employs psychological terror against the families of the captives. Its purpose is to exert pressure, to harm our resilience.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The family of four were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. <span class=credit>Facebook</span></figure><p>Bibas, Shiri, and their sons – who have been nicknamed “the Reds” for their striking flame-colored hair – were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7 during Hamas’ sneak attack on southern Israel.</p><p>A few days later, a gut-wrenching video emerged of the terrified family being taken from their home by the terrorists.</p><p>The image of a distressed Shiri clutching her small sons to her chest instantly became a symbol of Israeli suffering as the war against Hamas kicked off.</p><p>Kfir is the youngest hostage captured by Hamas in the monstrous attack that killed around 1,200 Israelis.</p><p>The family of four was hiding in their safe room when Hamas descended on the picturesque kibbutz.</p><p>“They’re coming in,” Bibas texted his family in the moments before their abduction, the New York Times reported.</p><p>Bibas was seen bleeding from his head in the abduction video, and family members believe he is being held separately from his wife and children,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Times of Israel noted</a>.</p><p>Israeli officials announced on Tuesday that Hamas had given the family to another Palestinian terror group that was holding them in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Video of Shiri Silverman-Bibas being taken with her two redheaded kids became a symbol of the brutality of the Oct. 7 attack.</figure><p>The second group was supposedly the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Times of Israel said.&nbsp;</p><p>The fighting in the southern part of the region has been less intense, as the IDF focuses its efforts on Hamas cells in Gaza City and the surrounding areas.</p><p>One day later on Wednesday, Hamas issued a statement announcing Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir’s deaths.</p><p>Despite the avalanche of terrible news, the family’s relatives said that they will remain optimistic about their fate until the Israeli investigation is completed.</p><p>“Hamas abducted them alive. Hamas is solely responsible for their well-being. Hamas must return them to us alive,” Shiri’s cousin Jimmy Miller told Channel 12 news, per the Times of Israel.</p><p>“We’re not interested in whether they transferred them to somebody else or to some other group. Hamas is solely responsible for returning them to us alive, healthy and intact… Make no mistake,” he insisted.</p><p>Their loved ones are not “waiting for an official announcement” as to whether Hamas’ claims are “true or not, or another kind of trick that Hamas is playing on us,” Miller said.</p><p>Another cousin, Eylon Keshet,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on CNN</a>&nbsp;Wednesday clutching a picture of baby Kfir.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ten-month-old Kfir Bibas is the youngest hostage taken by Hamas. <span class=credit>Family handout</span></figure><p>“We are really, really worried about him,” Keshet told the network.</p><p>“We are not sure if he can make it. Every day that he is staying there is a real, real danger to his life.”The video of Bibas is the latest in a string of troubling messages and clips Hamas has shown of the hostages, which experts say are part of its campaign to elicit international sympathy while supposedly pretending to coddle their prisoners.</p><p>One example – a letter purportedly written by released hostage Danielle Aloni, in which she thanks the terrorists for caring for her young daughter – was slammed by her family as “propaganda” meant to torture the captives from afar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmbGhfo7K4v46hmKaZo2K%2FprjEmqqeq12rtqWxzmamn2WSnq%2Biv4yfmKahnK56orLTnqlmm5yWtq61zaBkopyWYsC1vsiknGajmaG5prCMpqamZWJiuKqw0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./horace-grant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Horace Grant">&larr;
