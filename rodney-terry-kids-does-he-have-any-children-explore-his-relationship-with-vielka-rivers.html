However, he has two boys from his girlfriend Vielka’s previous marriage: Prince Elias and Eden Ewing. Rodney and Vielka have had a serious relationship for the last six years. The pair first publicly posted photos of their time together in 2018 after a gaming night.</p><p>Rodney is not Vielka’s real father, but he is very involved in the lives of her two boys. Rodney Terry was never a player; he was always coaching and educating. After graduating from St. Edward’s in 1990, he started coaching at the same institution where he attended.&nbsp;Terry went on to become the first head coach at Somerville High School in Somerville, Texas.&nbsp;As his career progressed, he was named head coach of the University of Texas El Paso men’s basketball team on March 12, 2018. Terry took over as Texas’ full-time head coach in 2023.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rodney-terrys-kids-does-he-have-any-with-girlfriend-vielka></span>Rodney Terry’s Kids: Does He Have Any With Girlfriend Vielka?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rodney Terry, the head coach, may not have biological children, but he is very close to his girlfriend Vielka’s boys, Eden Samuel Ewing and Prince Elias.&nbsp;One of the boys has already made waves in the basketball world. Eden Samuel Ewing, born on January 12, 1997, in Richmond (Texas), is making significant progress in basketball.</p><p>He is six feet eight inches tall and plays as a small forward for Fortaleza B.C. in Brazil, having joined the club in 2023. Eden originally demonstrated his abilities as a power forward for Purdue during the 2017-18 NCAA season. He then went to Texas Southern University, where he spent his last two seasons.&nbsp;In addition to his college career, he has also represented the Brazilian basketball team Minas Belo Horizonte.&nbsp;While Eden’s basketball career is well-documented, details regarding Vielka’s youngest son, Prince Elias, are more hidden.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rodney-terrys-girlfriend-vielka-rivers></span>Rodney Terry’s Girlfriend, Vielka Rivers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Rodney Terry</strong>, the head coach, has been romantically involved with <strong>Vielka Rivers</strong> since 2018.&nbsp;Their love is an open book on social media, with Terry routinely posting photos of them together, particularly on important occasions like Valentine’s Day and Vielka’s birthday.&nbsp;Despite not being married, the pair has a deep relationship and shares their experience with their social media followers.</p><p>Vielka, the Texas basketball coach’s girlfriend, is also a wealthy entrepreneur.&nbsp;She is the proprietor of Mercer Salon, a well-known salon that provides excellent services to customers.&nbsp;Vielka is a great designer, model, and instructor who also runs her own company.&nbsp;Despite being involved in a public relationship, Vielka is a private person. Her private Instagram account demonstrates her preference for keeping her life out of the public eye.&nbsp;Terry disclosed the couple’s relationship to the world in 2018, during a gaming night, and they have been documenting their journey together ever then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfmbumxYytnKuqqWK4qrDSZpuonaNitaZ5x5qtnmWRo8Zur8eio52qlaN6psTPpaarnV2dtrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16t7XEpaKaZaKew6a%2B0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sharp-objects-2018.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sharp Objects movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2018)">&larr;
