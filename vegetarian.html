Just like carrot cake, they’re soft, moist, and filled with warm, spiced flavor. Walnuts or pecans add nutty crunch, and a tangy cream cheese frosting takes them over the top. Right now, I’m using all my willpower to resist running down the kitchen and devouring one on the spot. But no! I want to tell you all about these carrot cake cookies first. They’re the perfect spring treat – wholesome enough for an afternoon snack, brunch, or…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Whenever I make a recipe that calls for shredded carrots – say, a salad or carrot cake – I always shred my own at home. I tend to avoid pre-cut produce as a rule, but I especially steer clear of bagged grated carrots. They’re drier and more brittle than ones I grate myself. Plus, when I shred carrots at home, I can taste their natural sweetness. Out of the bag, their flavor isn’t nearly as good. Taste aside, you could argue that buying shredded carrots saves time. But if it does, it doesn’t save much. This method for how to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This kale smoothie recipe is such an energizing way to start the day! Now that the weather’s warming up in Chicago, it’s made its way into my breakfast rotation of freezer burritos, muffins, and avocado toast. Refreshing and nutritious, it’s what I crave on mornings when the sun is shining, the air smells sweet, and it really feels like spring is on its way. The magic of this kale smoothie recipe is that it doesn’t actually taste like kale. Don’t get me wrong, kale’s flavor has its time and place. It’s irresistible in a kale salad or pasta, but in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Who else loves cauliflower recipes?! I’m a fan of this humble veggie not just because it’s delicious (which it is) or healthy (also true), but because it’s so darn versatile. It can blend into creamy soups and sauces without the help of nuts or dairy, and it can transform into a low-carb substitute for noodles or rice. You can boil it, steam it, sauté it, roast it, or even eat it raw. My question is, what can’t&nbsp;cauliflower do? Because cauliflower is one of the vegetables I cook most often throughout the winter and early spring, I thought now would be…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Can you imagine getting out of bed in the morning, knowing that a vegan breakfast burrito is already waiting for you in the kitchen? You don’t have to do a ton of prep or clean up. Heck, you don’t really have to do anything except for popping it in the microwave and eating it. Does that sound idyllic or what? Well, my friend, I have good news for you. This vegan breakfast burrito freezes perfectly, so you can a prep stash in advance and keep them on hand for busy mornings. They’re healthy, flavorful, and packed with plant-based protein. Served…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I was growing up, I ate chocolate chip muffins for breakfast nearly every morning. They were one of my mom’s specialties – moist, tender, and lightly sweet. Served warm, with a cold glass of milk to drink, they were an unbeatable way to start the day. These days, I prefer coffee or tea to milk, but I still savor a chocolate chip muffin whenever I get the chance. Lately, “whenever I get the chance” has been pretty much all the time, because I’ve been baking this chocolate chip muffin recipe on repeat. If you also happen to love chocolate…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There’s no denying that store bought almond milk is convenient, but when you have the time, making homemade almond milk is always worth it. It’s creamier and nuttier than commercial almond milk, and it’s made with just 2 ingredients: almonds and water. No stabilizers or shelf-life-extending additives here! You’ll find my method for how to make almond milk below. It’s amazingly simple – just soak, blend, and strain! – and the milk itself is super versatile. You can splash it over granola, add it to a latte, blend it into a smoothie, or use it in your favorite baked goods.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Each year, when winter starts to melt into spring, I refresh my rotation of easy weeknight dinners. The weather begins to change, and so do my cravings. On some days, I’m still in the mood for the cozy comfort food of winter – hearty pastas, soups, and stews – but on others, I’m hungry for weeknight dinners that are lighter and brighter. This year especially, I’m ready for a change. I don’t know about you, but I feel like I have cooked more in the last 12 months than I ever thought possible. Right now, weeknight dinners that are quick…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If we’re getting technical, this broccoli pesto isn’t really a pesto at all. It’s missing one of the key ingredients that makes pesto, pesto: nuts! Pine nuts are a signature ingredient in traditional basil pesto, thickening it and adding nutty richness. Though I often swap them for pepitas, walnuts, hemp seeds, etc., I typically make pesto with some sort of nut or seed. But in this recipe, the broccoli steps in for the nuts. It’s not an exact replacement by any means, but I love the results. This broccoli pesto is lighter and brighter than a traditional pesto. It also…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love the simplicity of this cannellini beans recipe. I first started making it last spring, when our trips to the grocery store were few and far between. You only need a handful of ingredients to make it – dried cannellini beans, aromatics, lemon juice, and Swiss chard – and even those are flexible. If you don’t have cannellini beans, substitute other dried white beans, like Great Northern or navy beans. If you don’t have chard, use kale or spinach. No shallot? Try an onion. No – well, you get the idea. After a long, hands-off simmer, these humble ingredients…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I need a super-fast, super-fresh side dish to round out a meal, I make this steamed broccoli recipe. The whole process takes under 10 minutes, prep time and cleanup included, and the results are always delicious. The steamed broccoli is crisp-tender and vibrant green. I love it on its own (the steaming brings out the broccoli’s natural sweetness), but it’s even better with salt, pepper, and a big squeeze of lemon juice on top. How to Steam Broccoli My method for how to steam broccoli couldn’t be simpler! Here’s how it goes: First, prepare the broccoli.
