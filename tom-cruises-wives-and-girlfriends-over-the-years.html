Is it the fact that he has been and still holds the record as one of the highest-paid actors in the longest run, or his extensive list of blockbusters? Whatever the factor, Cruise's fans know and so does the industry, that there's no one who can take his spot. The 61-year-old actor is both a global sensation and yet, an enigma. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, Cruise was an aspiring athlete as a kid before a knee injury landed him in drama classes. He kicked off his promising journey in the 80s, scoring minor, and supporting before landing the ultimate breakthrough as Pete "Maverick" Mitchell in<i> Top Gun,</i> in 1996. &nbsp;</p><p>In spite of all the stellar success he has achieved, Cruise, who has long thrived on his well-liked image as the archetype of the White Hollywood boy, bettered by his incomprehensible action-packed performance, has had a challenging personal life. At 61, the Academy-nominated star has been married and divorced three times. &nbsp;</p><h2>Inside Tom Cruise's Three Failed Marriages! &nbsp;</h2><p>Sustaining a marriage has been nothing but mission impossible for the Academy-nominated. Tom has had many wonderful relationships over the years, out of which he walked down the aisle with three women- only to end things all three of them just as fans thought things were going well for the actor. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/31/355348289_574913954565241_6128848449163684338_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698767346439.jpg><p>The first woman to bond with Cruise in the holy matrimony was actress <strong>Mimi Rogers</strong>. The <i>Top Gun</i> actor had a few famous relationships before embarking on a two-year-long romantic bliss with Rogers in 1985. The couple walked down the aisle in May 1987 and announced their separation in 1990. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, Rogers, a second-generation member of the controversial Scientology, had a lasting impact on Cruise's career, and his life in general. The actress, who is best known for her roles in <i>Gung Ho, Desperate Hours, </i>and <i>Lost in Space</i>, was the first person to introduce Cruise to the cult-like religion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/31/355078919_281335747681285_2537147463771217284_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698767352703.jpg><p>Mimi had already been divorced once (she was married to <strong>Jim Rogers</strong> for four years) and an ardent follower of Scientology when she started dating Tom, who, later in his career, would be notoriously associated with the religion. Although their shared faith connected them, Cruise shared that they couldn't work out many differences that separated them. &nbsp;</p><p>Following his divorce from Rogers in 1990, Tom didn't waste much time in kick-starting another significant romance. He met his then-future second wife, <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong>, on the sets of their 1990 film,<i> Days of Thunder</i>. After only a few months of dating, the couple tied the knot in a whirlwind fashion, on Christmas Eve of 1990. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/31/378079081_774094541157956_3286240696533174217_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698767359347.jpg><p>The <i>Risky Business</i> actor and the Oscar-winning Kidman were married for over a decade, during which they adopted two children, <strong>Isabella Jane, </strong>and <a href=#>Connor Antony</a><strong>, </strong>and worked together in multiple movies, including <i>Far and Away, Eyes Wide Shut, </i>and <i>The Others.</i> The former power couple's marriage came to a crashing end in early 2001. &nbsp;</p><p>It was Cruise who pulled the plug and decided to file for divorce. Although the <i>Mission Impossible</i> actor cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason behind their split, a few speculations have surfaced over the years. The most concerning theory was made by <strong>Mike Rinder</strong>, a Scientology apostate. &nbsp;</p><p>Rinder claimed that the controversial church got in between the couple by illegally prying into their lives and looking into Kidman's influence on Cruise. The<i> Rain Man </i>actor married his third wife, actress <strong>Katie Holmes</strong>, on November 18, 2006, after over a year of romance. &nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Holmes allegedly left Cruise to protect their daughter Suri from the Church of Scientology!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>But before delving into their conjugal life, the couple had welcomed a daughter, <a href=#>Suri,</a> in April 2006. It was a matter of six years before the <i>Top Gun </i>actor realized that the third time wouldn't be a charm either. Holmes, an esteemed actress, known for her roles in<i> Dawson's Creek, The Ice Storm,</i> and more, filed for divorce in 2012. &nbsp;</p><p>The duo's divorce was finalized within 11 days and Holmes was granted primary custody of their daughter. The long-estranged couple never shared what led to their divorce but Cruise once <a href=#>insinuated</a> that Holmes ended their marriage to protect her daughter from the Church of Scientology. &nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Tom Cruise Dating? &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>The Oscar-nominated actor is continuing his search to find the one. As per sources, Cruise has been in the market for a while but hasn't been lucky enough to find a significant someone. Recent reports claimed a possible romantic connection between Cruise and <strong>Shakira, </strong>who separated from her boyfriend of 11 years, <strong>Gerard Piqué,</strong> in 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/31/36595803_433319427183455_7448666527668109312_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698767370713.jpg><p>The pair sparked dating rumors after being spotted together at the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Miami. But the latest update on the rumored pair has been nothing but a bummer, well, at least for the Oscar-nominated actor. A source has revealed that while the<i> Mission Impossible</i> actor is "excessively flirting" with the Columbian singer, Shakira isn't one bit interested in Tom. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/31/30605196_365295320647541_708859913840885760_n%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)-1698767377683.jpg><p>Tom has been romantically associated with very few women since his 2012 divorce from Holmes. The <i>Top Gun</i> actor was last linked with his <i>Mission Impossible 7 </i>co-star, <strong>Hayley Atwell</strong>, in 2020. Besides his three failed marriages, Cruise has had a number of famous relationships over the years, including with <strong>Penélope Cruz, Cher</strong>, and <strong>Heather Locklear</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq2mpmWTp8Kqv8SsZLChpprAbq3NnWSgoaKhs7O1xKebrGWfq7KzedOhnGaxlZa%2FtA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tribeca-review-good-girl-jane-is-elevated-by-poignant-performances.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tribeca Review: Good Girl Jane is elevated by poignant performances">&larr;
