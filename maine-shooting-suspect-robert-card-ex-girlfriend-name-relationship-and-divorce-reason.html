He is the alleged shooter who opened fire at a pub and bowling alley, leaving 18 people dead and 13 injured.</p><p>Card is still at large and regarded as armed and dangerous, therefore the authorities have expanded their manhunt to include Canada in their active search for him.</p><h2>Name of Robert Card’s Ex-Girlfriend Who Was Shot Suspect in Maine</h2><p>The suspect Robert Card mass shooting in Maine took a dark turn when it was revealed that there may have been a reason for the horrifying shooting spree.</p><p>Investigators were informed by Card’s sister that she believes he may have been planning a shooting spree that resulted in the deaths of eighteen people and the wounding of thirteen more.</p><p>Card reportedly left behind a somber suicide letter that was intended for his kid.</p><p>The likelihood that this horrific mass shooting started as a home argument is now being investigated by the police.</p><p>The suspect’s ex-wife’s details were made public in court filings, but the name of the ex-girlfriend remains unknown.</p><p>When detectives found the mysterious message at Card’s Bowdoin home while serving a warrant, it was reported to be a suicide note that included personal information, random thoughts, and bank account information.</p><p>Law enforcement authorities said that the message hinted at Card’s plan to commit suicide by giving directions and information on where certain things might be found and disposed of.</p><p>Law enforcement organizations from the federal, state, county, and municipal levels are putting in great effort in their quest to find Robert Card.</p><h2>Timeline of Robert Card’s Relationships and Reasons for Divorce</h2><p>The cause for Robert Card’s divorce and the period of their relationship were kept private.</p><p>At the time, it was known that Robert Card had previously been married, but that his divorce had occurred in 2007.</p><p>“Irreconcilable differences” was the reason given for the divorce’s approval.</p><p>It’s a typical legal term used to characterize a scenario in which a married couple’s disagreements or problems have gotten to the point where they can no longer work things out and stay married.</p><p>It was also disclosed that the divorce decree was modified in 2013 after the separation in 2007.</p><p>This modification stipulated that the kid’s principal home would be with their mother and that they would share parental rights and obligations for their then-minor child.</p><p>There were no particulars regarding the timeframe of their relationship that led to the divorce or any more insights into the dynamics of their partnership in the material that was accessible.</p><p>Furthermore, the information up to that time had not made any particular reasons for the divorce or current events publicly available.</p><p>Most of the material that is now accessible is on the horrific circumstances of the mass shooting in Maine and the subsequent inquiries into this tragedy.</p><p>In Lewiston, Maine, a bar and grille and a bowling alley saw the horrifying shooting that Robert is suspected of carrying out, which left 18 people dead and 13 injured.</p><p>Because of this, a large portion of the media attention has focused on the investigation’s development, attempts to find and capture Robert, and possible contributing causes to this tragic incident.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>person of interest</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Maria Bello | Breast Cancer | Health</a></h3>American actress, writer, and producer Maria Bello is well-known for her roles in theater, television, and motion pictures.Maria Elena Bello became a leading lady in Hollywood by appearing in seve <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Are Roman Skorniakov And Tatiana Malinina?
