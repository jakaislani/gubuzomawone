Mike was a man whose activities while alive touched many people. So when it was announced that he had passed on, there was a tremendous outpour of sympathy and support.&nbsp;</p><p>Many reached out to Sharon after the news broke, hoping to relieve her pain because they knew how close she had been to Mike. Since his demise, she has grown more popular as many have become curious about her life and what will become of her.</p><p>Here’s what we know about Sharon Leach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/miike.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Sharon_Leach_Mike_Leachs_Wife></span>Who Is Sharon Leach, Mike Leach’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike Leach and Sharon Leach were married for more than three decades. Different sources have identified them as college sweethearts as they both went to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. They were introduced to one another by friends, and they became friends first before they started dating.</p><p>Sharon’s sister would later marry one of Mike’s former roommates. In 2012, Sharon revealed that their first date was not planned. They had only gone out because Mike was hungry.</p><p>She said: “He probably had the two-for-one coupons, and I was the freebie.”&nbsp;</p><p>Sharon was a legal secretary and administrative assistant for 14 years. However, she quit her job and became a stay-at-home mother after her husband became the OC at the University of Kentucky.</p><p>It proved a great solution as the couple had to parent four children, three girls, and a boy. It would have been difficult for them to pull it off if Sharon had kept her job because Mike was always busy.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharon revealed in 2014: “I don’t think many people understand just how many hours are spent coaching and recruiting a college football team.”&nbsp;</p><p>She continued: “Long ago, I realized that Mike’s job was coaching, and my job was everything else. I was OK with that. I loved college football as much as he loved coaching it.”</p><p>The couple were happy together, and they made things work. Sharon kept the family functional while Mike devoted his time to running a football team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sharon_Leach_Kids></span>Sharon Leach Kids&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike and Sharon Leach welcomed four kids together while he was alive. Their children include Cody Leach, Kim Leach, Kiersten Leach, and Janeen Leach.</p><p>Mike and Sharon were great parents but never shared much about their kids. They were known to be dedicated to privacy, so little information is available on their kids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sharon_Leachs_Net_Worth></span>Sharon Leach’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her net worth is currently undisclosed, but we know she lives comfortably. On the other hand, the extent of her late husband Mike Leach’s wealth is well known.&nbsp;According to different sources, Mike’s<a href=#> net worth</a> was estimated to be $8 million.</p><p>Most of his wealth was amassed thanks to his busy job as a coach. He coached at least three different teams during his time and made valuable contributions to all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sharon_Leachs_Husband_Mike_Leach></span>Sharon Leach’s Husband, Mike Leach<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike Leach was hired as Mississippi State’s head coach in 2020 after spending eight seasons with Washington State. He has a record of 19-17 while he was with the team.</p><p>Mike made his name in college football as one of the men to create the Air Raider offense that set numerous records. He was named coach of the year twice and led Mississippi State to an 8-4 record for the 2022 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mike-Leachs-hairdo-from-Mae-and-Jackson-fotor-2023072863349.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mike_Leachs_Death></span>Mike Leach’s Death&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The varsity football coach passed away in December 2022. His death was first reported on December 13, 2022, after being rushed to the hospital in critical condition. At first, many believed the coach would be able to pull through. They encouraged Sharon to remain hopeful while she prayed for him to get better.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/leach.jpg><p>Sadly, Mike could not hold out and was soon declared dead. The Mississippi State University announced the elite coach’s death in a statement that revealed Mike died due to complications from a heart condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharon has had to live without her dearest husband, but she continues pushing forward for the sake of her kids and friends. Other famous faces like Mike’s that have passed due to heart complications include Larry King and<a href=#> Elizabeth Taylor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>They may have passed on, but the legacy they left behind still stands even today.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZquYlr%2BwuoylnJqbmGK6qrfEZqOemZOdwG7DyJ2msGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./48-5-lbs-to-kg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="48.5 lbs to kg - 48.5 pounds to kilograms Conversion by NCESC">&larr;
