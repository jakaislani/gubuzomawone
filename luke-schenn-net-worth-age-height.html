On November 2, 1989, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Schenn was born. Rita and Jeff Schenn are his parents.</p><p>The Los Angeles Kings selected his younger brother Brayden with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Brayden was eventually traded to the Philadelphia Flyers. Madison and Macy, Schenn’s younger sisters, are also siblings. Schenn completed his education at Saskatoon’s St. Joseph High School. When they lived in Saskatoon, his brother Brayden, as well as NHL teammates Colby Armstrong, Riley Armstrong, and Jarret Stoll, attended St. Joseph. Madison, Macy, and Brayden, his three younger siblings, all play hockey.</p><p>The Western Hockey League’s Kelowna Rockets were where Schenn played junior hockey (WHL). Schenn was selected for the League’s Second All-Star Team during his last WHL season. He was a highly anticipated prospect going into the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, and the Toronto Maple Leafs selected him in the first round, fifth overall.</p><p>With the Canadian junior national team, he captured a gold medal in the 2008 World Junior Championships.</p><p>During their quest for the Memorial Cup at the conclusion of the 2004–05 season, the Kelowna Rockets arranged for Schenn to join the group. The organization wanted him to get a feel for his potential role, so he shared a room with defenseman Shea Weber.

The Kelowna Rockets picked Schenn in the first round, 20th overall, of the 2004 Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft when he was still a member of the Contacts.</p><p>As a member of Team West in the 2006 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge in Regina, Saskatchewan, where his team finished seventh, Schenn had his first interaction with Hockey Canada. In the under-18 level, he represented Canada twice: in 2006 at the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, where his team took home the gold, and in 2007 at the IIHF World U18 Championships, when Canada came in fourth.
